# ComputerVision
Computer Vision in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence involves the concept of creating vision perception from images. A most notable form of computer vision is image recognition and classification, which can be easily done with little computation using neural networks frameworks such as Tensorflow or Keras. 

A more traditional approach to computer vision is marker recognition, which is done with image manipulation and pixel comparison and pattern matching. OpenCV is a powerful cross-platform library for graphic and image manipulation. 

This repository is dedicated to explores computer vision and work on computer vision related projects including course-related, and personal interest projects.
