# Arrow Recognition
Arrow Recognition is a project aimed to make a simple
system for navigating robots. This simple system uses neural networksto classify 
up, down, left and right arrows to drive a robot in those directions. This simple 
system does not perform any obstacle detection or dept perception analysis.
