# Arrow Recognition
Arrow Recognition is a project aimed to make a simple
program demonstrating computer vision and robot navigation. This simple program uses neural networks to classify 
up, down, left and right arrows to drive a simulated box in those directions. This simple 
program does not perform any obstacle detection or depth perception analysis.
